# 4x4_Rover_ESP32

*video coming eventually*

Generic platform for 1:10 scale robot rover (skid steer style) with ESP32 and PS4 controller.  Hardware [mostly] from scratch. The 1:10 scale (primarily wheel span and chassis width) mimics some common RC and toy-scale bodies. Makes a uniquie sleeper build that can share a body from off-the-shelf kids toys.
